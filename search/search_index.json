If you feel like contacting me, nothing stops you, just contact me on discord.

Yasiki is a work-in-progress decompilation project of Luigi's Mansion for the Nintendo GameCube . The focus is currently laid on the Japanese release (GLMJ01), but configurations exist for all available versions. The original creator first focused on the North American release (GLME01), and it's symbols.txt was copied to a backup file. Note: this will not produce a playable game , if you do not supply it beforehand. This repo will get updates, but I have personal stuff to do, and so I/t wont be active all the time. Warning This game does no t ship with symbols , so information is scraped together from RTTI and connected games. Not as simple as most projects, but possible.

About this project This project uses the Decomp-Toolkit template . Progress state Folder structure Documents Misc Progress state Rather early. I was trying to fill out the symbols in the Ghidra repository (read further to learn how to connect to the server), but decided to start with matching libraries instead, as the game code uses them, and it is better to go step for step rather than losing the sight of progress. Folder structure The folders are split by categories in the project's root, where non-category folders are lowercase. As follows: ./CategoryName/... ./config/... ./tools/... Most modules in a library rely on the modular scheme used originally, such as: ./JSystem/System/JKernel/{src|include} , ./JSystem/System/JSupport/{src|include} , ./JSystem/JAudio/JAInterface/{src|include} , ./Project/Kawamoto/{src|include} , ./Project/Sotoike/{src|include} , ./Project/Koga/{src|include} , and so on. My goal is to stay as original as possible, while still making it possible to work with for the decompiling efforts. Documents I\u2019ve also included some small private notes in /docs/game/*.txt , which may contain useful information (if needed). Misc You can put personal stuff in /private/, it is ignored by github. I prefer communication through the Discord, Yasiki Parlor , but you can open issues as needed. Contributing You are welcome to contribute, even pointing out small mistakes/issues counts as contributing! The guidelines for contributing have yet to be written, but that hopefully won't stop you. Setting up build Windows: On Windows, it's highly recommended to use native tooling. WSL or msys2 are not required. When running under WSL, objdiff is unable to get filesystem notifications for automatic rebuilds. Install Python and add it to %PATH% . Also available from the Windows Store . Download ninja and add it to %PATH% . Quick install via pip: pip install ninja macOS: Install ninja : brew install ninja Install wine-crossover : brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover After OS upgrades, if macOS complains about Wine Crossover.app being unverified, you can unquarantine it using: sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine '/Applications/Wine Crossover.app' Linux: Install ninja . For non-x86(_64) platforms: Install wine from your package manager. For x86(_64), WiBo , a minimal 32-bit Windows binary wrapper, will be automatically downloaded and used. Building Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Moddimation/Yasiki.git Copy your game's disc image to orig/<VERSION> . Supported formats: ISO (GCM), RVZ, WIA, WBFS, CISO, NFS, GCZ and TGC. After initial build, you may remove the image. Also delete all files in orig/<VERSION> except orig/<VERSION>/sys/main.dol to save space, if you don't need the assets as reference. Configure: python configure.py To use a version other than GLMJ01 (Japan), specify --version <version . (See all possible versions at the top) Example usage (See its github for detailed usage): python configure.py --version GLME01 (US Release). python configure.py --version GLMP01_2 (EU Release Rev 1) python configure.py --debug Build with debug python configure.py --map Build and generate map (for comparison) python configure.py progress Show progress, nothing else Build: ninja Useful: ninja diff When failing to build, check the differences (command line only). ninja apply When finished decompiling a file, and marking it as Matching in configure.py, this updates the symbols.txt for correctness. Diffing Once the initial build succeeds, an objdiff.json should exist in the project root. Download the latest release from encounter/objdiff . Under project settings, set Project directory to the root, aka the file containing the objdiff.json file. The configuration should be loaded automatically, and if not, ensure that the build generated no errors. If it did, resolve these and try again. Select an object from the left sidebar to begin diffing. Changes to the project will rebuild automatically: changes to source files, headers, configure.py , splits.txt or symbols.txt . Setting up Ghidra Ghidra is a tool that automatically decompiles code. Although Ghidra's output is not accurate enough to be directly copy-pasted into this decompilation project, it can still be helpful for understanding functions and decompiling them faster. You are free to use other decompilation methods, such as IDA, m2c or manually, but ghidra was chosen as the preferred tool in the gamecube/wii decomp scene. I've got a shared Ghidra project for LuigisMansion already set up, that I usually update. To get access to this server: Go to https://ghidra.decomp.dev and link your Discord account. Create a Ghidra account by entering a new username and password into the form on the right. Request \"Read\" access to the LuigisMansion server. Then wait for an admin to approve your request. Once you have access, you can set up the Ghidra project like so: To use Ghidra, you first need to install JDK. You can download OpenJDK 17 from here . Download the RootCubed Ghidra build ghidra_11.4_DEV_20250425 from the link in the Download section here . (*OPTIONAL) If you wish to load/analyze other binaries for gamecube/wii, you need the Ghidra-GameCube-Loader extension, which you can get on the RootCubed Ghidra page. Launch Ghidra with ghidraRun . In Ghidra, go to File -> New Project... . Select Shared Project and input the following information: Server Name: ghidra.decomp.dev Port Number: 13100 User ID: (the username that you chose earlier) Password: (the password that you chose earlier) You should now be able to view the files in the Ghidra project. You should checkout the main file. Now you have Ghidra set up and ready to use. For an introduction on how to use Ghidra, you can read this section of the Twilight Princess decompilation's guide .
